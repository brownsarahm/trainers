Attending: Kelly, Karen, Mark, Sarah
Apologies: Jeff, Pao
Absent: Bonny

1. Core Team Updates
    - Checkout Project Recommendations
        - Summary
        - Opportunity for initial discussion
            - Mark: Slack is still inaccessible for many trainers; having 
            e-mail lists might be better option
            - Karen: E-mail is overwhelming for some
            - Mark: Email is nice because _everyone_ uses it
            - Kelly: There is a good community already on Slack, although 
            keeping Slack participation optional is a good idea
            - Sarah: Could include new Trainers on a monthly basis
            - Mark: Changing topics, who is going to run the Welcome sessions?
            - Kelly: Community Development team (as part of Core Team) is 
            already running these and will scale this up with Core Team
            - Sarah: Could Discussion hosts help out with this?
            - Kelly: Yes, there is a slide deck available
            - Karen: We want to be sure we have capacity for these even without 
            relying on Discussion hosts
            - Mark: Are we going to provide a list of suitable episodes for 
            teaching demos
            - Kelly: Yes
            - Mark: Demo changes: multiple people doing the same episode may 
            not be ideal
            - Sarah: Demo changes: is this removing a challenge that is also 
            inherent to teaching, such that this challenge is just deferred to 
            the teaching experience? If they are intimidated by studying the 
            whole thing they may not be prepared to teach, to be a good 
            co-Instructor because you have familiarity with the full lesson
            - Mark: yes but being prepared to teach vs being aware is 
            different. First time instructing maybe they only teach a couple of 
            episodes. 
            - Kelly: there are instances where you need to teach things you 
            weren't expecting to teach, but not knowing where you will start is 
            a little artificial. In most cases you know what you will teach and 
            can plan for it. 
            - Karen: fear of judgment in testing environment and inequity is 
            clincher for me
            - Sarah: It isn't reasonable to expect Trainees to memorize an 
            entire episode
            - Sarah: is there a way to not pass someone who seems like they are 
            not sincere, that they are on autopilot having memorized their 
            actions for this short performance. Maybe both demo and feedback 
            both have to be good?
            - Mark: maybe they still prepare the full lesson in advance, but 
            24h in advance are notified what episode they will teach from?
            - Kelly: Does anyone have input on the 3rd step (Replace lesson 
            contribution with a broader "Get Involved" step)?
            - Sarah: 3rd step. Like the broad goal. Don't think signing up to 
            teach a workshop is enough. Needs to be a contribution to the 
            community. Recently heard of someone new teaching a 
            centrally-organized workshop who was not doing well. They need to 
            be interacting with other Carpentries people to be absorbing 
            practice. If you aren't as deep in the community you might not get 
            the same integration and support. 
            - Karen: we won't be evaluating these but can decide what's on the 
            list. That is, even if people choose something not on the list we 
            are not planning to tell people "no"
            - Mark: can this be preemptive? They can do them before they are 
            trained? Yes.
            - Kelly: we were thinking of not having a third step. Keeping the 
            bar low but having a nudge to get involved will do its job.
            - Sarah: think this needs to be specifically a way of engaging 
            *beyond* as a lead instructor. Demo certifies they are ready to 
            teach. Welcome session prepares them to teach a workshop. Maybe the 
            last piece of that is signing up to teach. This is where we want 
            Instructors who are part of the community because the socialization 
            of the community is what keeps quality consistent and keeps the 
            learner experience what we want it to be. When you have instructors 
            who don't talk to other instructors, don't start the habit they 
            won't ever do it. Tight local communities are OK, but otherwise 
            needs to be where they meet people, even asynchronous through a 
            lesson contribution, but 2-way interaction. Signing up is passive, 
            not interactive.  
        - Process for review and approval
            - Sarah: this power belongs to Trainers Leadership Committee (see 
              [Powers & Responsibilities document](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/powers_responsibilities.md))
            - Submit as proposal on GitHub with timeline for implementation
            - Follow up with some Trainers meeting presentations
            - Mark: This doesn't seem like it would be a long, drawn-out 
            process to make these changes
            - Kelly: That's right, we would mostly just need to update the 
            instructions in the curriculum.
    - Cancellation and Attendance Policy updates
        - This is FYI with interest in feedback async
        - Leaves the role of deciding who did and did not attend to Trainers
    - That email to Trainers that Karen still hasn't sent for reasons
        - Karen: We still need to have addition discussions with the Trainers 
        Leadership Committee about the philosophy of those "equivalent" 
        activities and what should and should not be accepted for consideration 
        of Trainer renewal
