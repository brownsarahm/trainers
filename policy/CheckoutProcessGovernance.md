### Checkout Process Governance

New instructors for the Carpentries are required to complete a checkout process after taking the instructor training course, and prior to becoming fully badged instructors. The current version is available at [checkout process](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/). 

While the checkout process is written for incoming instructors, there are many other stakeholders in the Carpentries community who are affected by changes to it. This document defines how changes can be made to the checkout process, who should be involved in decisions, and who should be notified when changes occur. In conversation with the Carpentries community, we learned that Trainers want to be kept up to date on changes, and would like to voice their opinions on 'substantial' changes, however they would prefer that 'minor' issues be dealt with by the Trainers Leadership Committee. The following process tries to take these, and other outcomes from our discussions, into account.

To differentiate 'substantial' from 'minor' changes, we recognize three possible types of change:

1. Change Requirements - add or drop an entire requirement
2. Rescope Requirements - Change which repos, meetings, or lessons are used for checkout
3. Change Participation Requirements - Refine rubric, alter meeting participation expectations, etc

## 1. Change Requirements

If whole requirements for checkout are to be removed, added, or greatly changed, the new proposed checkout process should be written in its entirety and submitted to the Trainer Community as a pull request (PR). The PR should be made in the appropriate lesson Github repository to facilitate commenting, the PR should have a set 'end of comment' date that is at least a month after the PR is created. The PR, and its end date, should be advertised in the Trainers Slack channel and the mailing list, and should also be the topic of at least one Trainer meeting during its open comment period. Any feedback should be incorporated either as changes to the proposal or discussed as a comment in the PR conversation to recognize that the feedback was considered and why it was not incorporated.

Once the PR date has passed, and comments are addressed, it should follow the Trainers Leadership rules for a final approval before merge. Once merged, the updates should be updated in any other documentation as appropriate (FAQs, handbook, etc), and an announcement should be made to the entire Carpentries community noting the change. The announcement should be done at least in Slack, the mailing list, and the next Trainer meeting.

## 2. Rescope Requirements

Rescoping changes should use the existing Trainers Leadership Committee mechanism to propose and adopt changes, however the Trainers Leadership Committee should explicitly discuss whether the proposed change is large or disruptive enough to warrant community input. If the Trainers Leadership Committee feels that the change will be large or decisive, it should be treated using the Change Requirements process. If the changes are minor, they should be dealt with using the Change Participation Requirements.

## 3. Change Participation Requirements

For these minor changes, proposals should use the existing Trainers Leadership Committee mechanism to propose and adopt changes. When changes are finalized, updates should be updated in any other documentation as appropriate (FAQs, handbook, etc), and an announcement should be made to the entire Carpentries community noting the change. The announcement should be done at least in Slack, the mailing list, and the next Trainer meeting.
