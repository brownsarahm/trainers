# 2022 March


## Summary 

In our first term as trainers leadership, we worked mostly on organizational matters.  We set up the infrastructure for the group to be successful and transparent in their operations going forward. We also worked carefully to flesh out details of how operations would balance agency with consensus.  Our biggest project completed beyond internal documentation was the transition from the Trainer Agreement to the new Trainer Certification Renewal Process.

## Certification Renewal

With the community, we agreed to and got approved a replacement to the trainer agreement.  The new certificaiton renewal makes it clear that the participation requirement is a requirement to remain a badged trainer, not a commitment of future service.  This took a lot of collaboration with the DIT and revision and substantial trainer community feedback to achieve. After approving the general Renewal process for the long term, we approved the 2022 specific Implementation to provide a clear and transparent community governed process that the Core team leads.

## Curriculum Update

We approved the major curriculum update and through this process developed a plan to guide future updated with the maintainer group and documented that in the [IT curriculum maintaince policy](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pull/126/files#diff-ad7c9123f8f09ebfb482afae9929a18b29c00104af429d51f04c8715213f29b7R47-R65)

We streamlined our procedures for approving mintues so that we could operate more efficiently.

## Community Building 

We used the November trainer meeting to listen to trainers at large about how they want to be involved and gather feedback to help facilitate projects initated in the first half of the term. We also completed a policy for governing the [checkout process transparently](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/policy/CheckoutProcessGovernance.md) and opened the [Instructor Training Curriculum Maintaince Policy](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pull/126) for broad comment. We moved to rely on the Curriculum Team for maintaining the approved lessons and episode for demos, because they have more knowledge.

## Looking Forward 

In the next term, we plan to focus on community. This begins with looking at how local communities work to determine how they can be supported by the global community and how their successess can be disseminated to other local communities.
