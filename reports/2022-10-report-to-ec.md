# 2022 November

## Summary

<!-- #region -->

 - [Develop "Trainer Meeting Guide" ](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/201)
 
 We developed a GitHub-based system for submission of topics to for discussion at Trainer Meetings, and added functionality to assign meeting hosts to topics and dates through this system. 
 - [Use this repo's issue list for potential Trainer Meeting topics](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/180)
 - [Use a Table-style Project on this repo for trainer meeting topic assignment](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/181)



 

 - [Rubric update and promotion plan for Open Instructor Training](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/172)

We worked with the Director of Instructor Training to develop and implement an updated and partly automated process for Trainer status renewal. As a result of this update, 35% of trainers who were due for renewal retained Active status automatically from data within AMY and were not required to provide any data themselves. A further 35% were renewed on review by the Committee and the Director IT based on activities self-reported as part of the updated processed. Only 30% required further follow-up, of whom over half appear to be no longer active and/or contactable anyway.
As part of the review process, additional criteria were identified which will further increase the number of fully automatic renewals in future, and improvements were made to the self-certification questionnaire which should reduce the number of cases requiring follow-up.

## Procedural Refinement

We formally assigned the task of writing biannual Executive Committee reports to the Committee chair, and implemented GitHub automation to assist this process
 - [March 2022 EC Report process](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/168)
 - [Script & action to initialize report with links](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pull/187)
We formalised the process for reaching a quorum for voting on proposals, agreeing that if a quorum is not reached at the meeting itself, proposals will be voted on asynchronously using GitHub issue comments. 
 - [Provide clarity on relevance of quorum for Trainers Leadership meetings](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/164)
We are recognised by the Executive Committee as a Carpentries Committee, but legacy references remained in the Carpentries repository and Handbooks with a variety of other titles. All such references which could be identified were updated so that the roles and responsibilities of the committee are unambigously provided in Carpentries information resources.
 - [Use consistent naming for Trainers Leadership Committee](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/193)

## Looking Forward 

In the next term, we plan to focus on community. This begins with looking at how local communities work to determine how they can be supported by the global community and how their successess can be disseminated to other local communities.
