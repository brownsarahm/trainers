### Meet the Leadership Candidates
* [https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/elections/Nominees2023.md](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/elections/Nominees2023.md)
* Questions:
* Liz: How many positions are we electing for? Is there a limit?
* All five! We should have done some staggering, but we didn't want to force people to commit to more than one year. It is a one year term of service.
* Karl: Are there limits on re-election? 
* Yes, there is a 3 year limit. This is part of the reason why Sarah Brown is stepping down.
* Mik: suppose you get elected. What makes your term a win for you?
* Karen: This is a good question to start the year!
* Nathaniel: successful working out any kink in transition to workbench. Settling checkout procedure that encourages people to be involved in the community beyond workshops
* Zac: Transition to the workbench. The transition of how we've done a lot of workshops and how we've trained instructors or found volunteers; thinking of how to prepare instructors for all the modalities we find ourselves in wrt to the current stressors. 
* Trisha: I've experienced a lot of variation in training. Going to do in person in April. I would like to make sure trainers are comfortable no matter what the setting is. A big win is that all of our trainers could feel comfortable hopping into any trainer session and teaching it. 
* Pao: Everything everyone has said are all big wins. From a leadership committee point of view, doing all these things while keeping everything transparent and incorporating the community and supporting the Core Team will be a win for me. 
* For all candidates - what do you uniquely bring to the leadership team
* Nathaniel: I have been on a lot of different sides of working with data education. (K-12, uni, Carpentries, etc). There are also other people on this list that have deep experience.
* Zac: We have a big community at Stanford including instructors and multiple trainers. What does a community look like in a big setting and the challenges of maintaining that?
* Trisha: Zac took my unique thing, but two more things: I have training as an educator (7-12 chem). Always talking and meeting with instructors to help improve the community health (see: [https://github.com/carpentries/community-development/issues/11#issuecomment-1351689620](https://github.com/carpentries/community-development/issues/11#issuecomment-1351689620))
* Pao: I have a year experience in the leadership committee. It would be good in the future to think about this transition and having people with experience to continue to learn and help others. I come from a part of the world that is not very present in The Carpentries (yet!), so I can bring a different point of view.
### Documentation updates for ratification
* Powers and Responsibilities: [https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pull/230](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pull/230)
* Certification Renewal: [https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org/pull/878](https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org/pull/878)
* primary reason for change is to reflect new ways of representing trainers in our database WRT to badging
* Questions:
* Jake: is there a difference between Instructor Trainer vs Trainer? Is IT now the Official(tm)?
* Karen: oh that's my bad
* Jeff: this highlights the point that the LC is here to deal with these kinds of decisions.
* Mik: What requires ratification by the full community?
* WRT [https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pull/230/files#diff-53213a4342e4c6d7fc7028476d53d4af643e7d32064def333e5cb90ac3748074R6](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pull/230/files#diff-53213a4342e4c6d7fc7028476d53d4af643e7d32064def333e5cb90ac3748074R6)
* [Zhian missed this because he fat-fingered his mechanical keyboard and put something in the search which jumped his etherpad]lol there is a catch-all in the 3rd item, so it is 2 things listed that we've identified (changes to requirements for renewal and change to powers) and anything anybody decides really needs/needed to be ratified once Leadership has done it, because we can't think of everything that the community might want to vote on.
