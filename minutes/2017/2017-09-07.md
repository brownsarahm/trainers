The new Carpentry Instructor Training curriculum is live! New modules include Mindset and Introductions. 

Christina Koch is starting a study group for Trainers to go through the new curriculum.

Alex isn't teaching soon, but is hoping to teach in London soon (at Imperial). 
Karen (and maybe Erin) are teaching 25-26 September. 
Mark is teaching the first week of November. Oklahoma is also training at the end of October. Sue and Francois are teaching and Mark will be helping/observing (local facilitator). 

Rayna taught in August with Sue, Karen Cranston and Anelda. Lots of challenges. 
- One concern with teaching small groups. For a long time thought that wasn't a great investment. But this time we had 4 rooms of 10 students. Too many for Etherpad (technical problems). Didn't get to know the students. Prefer to have more one-to-one mentoring.
- Was technically remote. Most instructors were remote but Sue was co-local with a group of students. Curious dynamic. They could have discussions during breaks but we couldn't. 
- Last minute instructor change caused disorganization. 
- LIkes 12-18 learners. (Groups of 6-9) Likes when group sites are divisible by 3. 2 sites is good but 3 sites is hard.

One things that's nice about fully distributed is that everyone's name and face are on the screen! Goes well for demos and discussion sessions. Can recognize people.

How familiar are people with the new materials?
- Mark was involved with commentary during his training. Has given a look through the new materials. Was part of the feedback loop.
- Alex got most impression through the Bug BBQ and has been watching the repository a little. 
- Rayna has not looked at the finished product yet. A few new modules. Paid attention and was happy with the re-organization. Will want to look deeply at the new modules.


Demo session discusson
- If someone puts in an episode for the demo I have allowed it. Maybe that's a little unfair. How important is it that we do this? Wouldn't it be easier if we came up with a list of episodes that learners could choose from?
- Conflicting goals. One is to show that people have the expertise from a content perspective. The other is expertise from a teaching methods perspecive. Currently we're asking them to master the content for the whole lesson. 
- Check for preparedness. Were they commited to learning enough of the lesson to lead the demo. Do they do the preparation enough?
- is it an undue burden on the trainee?
- It's good preparation. Doing them a favor. They don't have to prep the day before the workshop now. Helps them be prepared. 
- Made me feel more prepared and qualified. Knowing that I could teach all of the shell lesson and not just one episode.
- If we did have a list - there is a list but it's not exhaustive.
Better to make a list of episodes NOT to pick. 
-Checkouts are going to start to evolve as we build community champions.

## General discussion

Elizabeth - planning to sit in on a training before she teaches for real. 
Wants to do an informal book group with her faculty on How Learning Works (not affiliated with Carpentries)

Anita - doing training in October with Mateusz.  Still nervous about the online part - interested in ideas for what to do about teaching online
Christina - "It's not that bad!"  Think about your experience with conference calls like this one.  Be extra prepared.  You'll be using etherpad/google doc a lot since you won't have a screen, whiteboard, etc.
Have materials ready to copy and paste in advance.
Remember people will be forgiving of your mistakes.

Maneesha - Yes, having things ready to copy and paste is important.  Also have other tabs open so you can quickly reference other materials.  A second screen is also helpful so you can track things yourself.

Elizabeth - 3rd semester teaching an online asynchronous class.  Second screen makes a huge difference, plus having a printout as a backup.  Be very explicit about how you want people to use the chat, raise hands, etc. (esp when there are multiple options).  Remind them what kind of chats are appropriate - avoiding side conversations, it's for active questions.  Be explicit about other mechanisms - click here now, go to breakout room now, etc.

Chrstina: yes, be clear about breakouts, return time, ec.
