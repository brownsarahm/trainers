# notes
- Recent/upcoming trainings
  - Erin teaching two weeks from now at Stanford (in-person)
  - Christina just taught online with Tim
- EB: Now having a Google Drive available for storing notes. start collecting group knowledge!
- Story bank
  - RH: Rayna tried to use an example she really liked from Erin, and it didn't work
  - RH: Hard to have stories that go across places, but so valuable in having good stories / examples / analogies
  - CK: remembers Karin asking for more stories, but it's hard to capture/categorize general good stories vs personal stories (only you can do) vs specific stories
  - EB: Need to capture the variations (adding material) that people do as well.
- Big picture
  - Instructors should know the imporatance of modeling failure
  - More important to teach what learners are learning, but not all the ideas (learner-centered teaching)
  - CK: What's best for the learners, not what I want to teach
  - CK: Opening the door + giving a map, rather than walking people all the way to the destination
  - EB: So ingrained to "cover content x"
  - Creating a welcoming environment
- Lesson turnover/involvement
  - RH: Lessons go stale when the original creators stop teaching and contributing back
  - RH: Is there a way for communities to have little forks of curriculum that they can "own"
  - EB: Way to do more specific lesson discussions?  Not enough resources now, but... Would that be fracturing?
  - RH: But it also builds community, 
  - RH: What about having a weekly discussion on lesson?
  - CK: Need to split the discussion sessions into more channels --> de-brief, lesson-specific, workshop-logistics
  - RH: If you set the time + advertise, people will show up!  :)
  - EB: Bring some of these ideas to the new community manager
  - RH: Definitely, have the new person connect w/ *many* of our communities (around the world, internal, etc.)
- Upcoming trainers
  - fluent/native Spanish speaker
  - HPC? 
  - Librarians?
  - Social science, ed, business
  - "class" diversity -- having someone from a small institution
