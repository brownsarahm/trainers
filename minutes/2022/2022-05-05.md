## **Agenda**:



* Introductions
* Warmup question: if you were asked to host one (1) of these meetings, what is one support structure that would make that more approachable/fun/rewarding?
* highlight interactive opportunities (like the exercise parts of instructor training) - general for meetings
* maybe there are better platforms for facilitating.
* having a person monitor the chat/montage for hands raised
* interactivity or parallel channels to capture information during the meeting
* onboarding! Maybe a checklist or partner to talk things through before the meeting.
* more integrative tools - team hub where resources are collected to integrate all these communications. Topicbox, etherpad, other places to keep track.
* Agenda of ideas and topics that could pick from and decide how to make it interactive
* Being able to choose the time
* onboarding or process where you co-lead and then lead, maybe a few meeitngs in a row
* starting at 10 past so there is a buffer between meetings
* latitude to choose topic maybe 2nd meeting of the month listing topics that people would like to see
* nice to have a timekeeper to help
* dont' mind finishing earlier than scheduled.
* Pre and post workshop discussion
* Jeff and Michael. First time 4 half day - really liked it. 2-day is great but done about 5 hours in. Afternoons was great. Michael did a great job. Had late-scheduled meetings so had to step out; Michael filled in and Erin came to support.
* No differences in 4 half day, came to same points and had to cut the same things we usually do. Calendaring system and time breaks worked well
* Ann and Liz 4 half day event coming off of a long weekend here -- don't recommend that! Tuesday to Friday after Monday off. A bit of a challenge. Tried a couple of ways to split presentation. Each took one half day and then interspersed days 3 and 4. Prefer not taking a whole half day, that was a bit tough. Splitting/interspersing each half day was better. Pre-survey setup was really helpful. Schedule structure etc. Initially had 24 and then 2 people cancelled, down to 22. Then we actually only had 16 show up. We know people who would have liked to have joined, so that was disappointing. Do you overbook? But the 16 stuck the whole way through. We will run again in June, so we have some time to think and do it again. To do differently: tried only presenting 10 minutes at a time and then do an activity, had talking points for people to follow. Liz did less powerpoint and Ann did more with mixed reviews. Some people liked powerpoints and some didn't. Requests for more activities, trying to think of how to talk even less and have them do more. Small readings and sharing with each other. They wanted the materials before hand.
* 4 people signed up from USA and it was a terrible time. 12-4am, 11-3am. Didn't have to be exclusively for our region, but it is an opportunity for people in our time zones mixed involvement in the middle of the night.
* some people sign up by mistake

* Previously we could run jekyll to render locally
* Q: Previous we could run a local instal of Jekyl and render our content prior to pushing up content. Will there be a way to render the workbench framework locally to test prior to pushing up to the host platform?
* A (Zhian): Yes. Open R and run `sandpaper::serve()` (assuming you have gone through the setup): [https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/transition-guide.html#local-rendering](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/transition-guide.html#local-rendering)
