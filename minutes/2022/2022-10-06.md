### Introductions


### Pre and post Instructor Training discussion



* Evgenij 2 day online event with Philipp. He reported this morning. Feedback seemed good. First part was deemed theory heavy but that allowed us to reply to feedback immediately for more breakouts on second part of first day. Some zoom fatigue in full 2 day setting. Co-teaching one that is 4 half days in December so interested to see how that goes. On the ideas side, callout and exercises boxes but could think about categorizing common errors and mistakes in a box. On the one hand Instructors can use it as ideas or challenges in this way - could deliberately plant errors to showcase how to diagnose an error, showcase syntax errors, logical errors, open a new way to contribute at checkout to allow lesson additions that aren't really adding to the material. They enjoyed teaching practice in breakouts. They had concerns about historical violations of Code of Conduct. Someone was asking how we deal with this. They found the answer was too uncertain. It was nice to be able to point to the repository with the reports, but maybe we can package real cases as examples or come up with hypothetical examples. 
* Alycia: CoC facilitators training was developed, still draft, but here: [https://carpentries.github.io/community-facilitators-program/03-0-code-of-conduct-facilitation/index.html](https://carpentries.github.io/community-facilitators-program/03-0-code-of-conduct-facilitation/index.html)
* Scenarios, specifically, are here: 
* [https://carpentries.github.io/community-facilitators-program/03-4-code-of-conduct-facilitation-scenarios/index.html](https://carpentries.github.io/community-facilitators-program/03-4-code-of-conduct-facilitation-scenarios/index.html)
* Liz: Frameshift Consulting recently released a 20 min video, they also have a resource book 
* [https://frameshiftconsulting.com/resources/code-of-conduct-book/](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/resources/code-of-conduct-book/)
* Recognize that people asking for more breaks or curriculum; need for more space; need to start asking for Trainers to bring thoughts on when to cut and how to cut; if stuff has to be caught, need to find space in core curriculum
* Sarah: Trainer Leadership adn Core Team should provide semi-structured way of recording in your training what you skipped; somewhere to make those notes of what is skipped, would be best way going forward; provide some sort of tool to record in real time; difficult to remember these things
* Jeff: +1; almost always skip the "set up a workshop website"
* Evgenij: we skipped setting up the website and preparing to teach section
* Liz: thread in Slack channel, theming community discussion on introduction to Git for the purposes of instructor trainees preparting themselves for what lesson contribution is; no one wants to join co-working hour; instead of community discussion, would be good to look at model of tutorials to draw out something from Instructor trianing and give you opportunity to practice this, applying what you learned; way to bring you more into The Carpentries; would be easier for trainers to do; hour long commitment is better for the community and Trainers to support
* Karen: also like that idea; identifying content that is appropriate for just-in-time training when you want it later; similar to community discussion, have had trainers offer to do these community discussions in the past, might also be answer to challenges of administrating these
* Mark: On the topic of preparing for the Git preparation, is it possible to set up a dummy git repo that people can just play with. That might reduce concerns from trainees about accidentally breaking a real repo with their submission efforts.
* Sarah: I think related to that, Mark, is that we can emphasize that people who are not maintainers actually cannot cause data loss that impacts other people. A maintainer can always fix what is done.
* Liz: @mark would be good to see that as a collaborative activity for learners to comment on an issue in that section of instructor training.
* Karen: trainers enjoy the four half days so will likely find that your trainees like this model; can take more out of your schedule which is a downside for Trainers

  * Any takeaways so far? demos are most important step; lots of different things to say about lesson contributions and community discussions, need to recognize that they are not working as intended but intent was important; how do we accomplish those goals? Have been some good ideas (e.g., options to choose from or pathways to follow)
* Workbench transition update: [https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues/1396](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues/1396)

  * Suggestions or tips for making most effective use of the etherpad template
    * script for running demo sessions Liz has got one that I can share! Is there an issue @Karen that I can append a google doc list? [https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/discussions/95](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/discussions/95)
    * checklist for starting a zoom training (eg turning on captions, claiming host, etc)
    * How to keep an eye on timings for sections during instructor training! ANd how to cut on the run. 
    * Related to above (but not sure how to actually address this), how do you decide what to skip? Which is also apparently related to the point _below_, too. :)
    * How to cut some material on the day without inducing the fear of missing out. Often feedback is targeted towards sections that are cut ('It would be nice to do more (or to learn more about) X'
    * Based on meeting today, where to record or keep track of content that was skipped
    * How to get sound coming through Zoom for learners when the instructor plays a YouTube or other video
    * Checklist on putting on a training, e.g. similar to what in the handbook about putting on a workshop 
    * How to encourage participation? People are often reluctant to contribute directly by unmuting (online) or saying something (in person; tends to be somewhat less of an issue). Somebody mentioned announcing that an instructor will pick people at random but leaving an opportunity to pass.
    * How to track (sensibly) which lessons and episodes you've assessed, which episodes trainees have done previously if they are returning for a second try.
