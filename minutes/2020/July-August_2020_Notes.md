Agenda:
### Introductions
### Pre and post workshop discussion
- Afternoons, 4 half days, with Laura and Nico. In charge of general organization, following checklist step by step. Great opportunity to start growing the instructor community. Participants from different institutions. En Espanol!
- Paola teaching the first morning sessions. Also looking forward to the live coding sections. At least those will be her choices. Will be present in all sessions. Someone will always be taking notes etc.
- Draft for the schedule on the website. Changed one of the modules from the first day so it can fit better, into the second 4 hours. Maybe not changing the order but maybe push one from the end of one day to the beginning of the next.
- Translated the web page. Nico has some slides in Spanish from Peru training. We have some people that can manage in English, so we can point them to original material. Try to use the parts that are translated for the rest of the people. In case people are curious about more things, we are making some progress translating the Teaching Tech Together book [Greg Wilson]. 

### Announcements
- [side conversation about Zoom & chats: since the chat is ephemeral during the meeting, if there is a lot of content and Q&A in the chat it can be valuable to save and send to participants after the workshop. Chat can be saved to desktop in your own zoom room -- not clear where it goes or if it is saved for Carpentries rooms.]
- 4-half-day events: optimal schedule & other considerations?
- Should practice sessions be more spaced out?
- Short wrap-up sessions for every day, unsure about homework, though (Annika)
- Easy to lose focus during these online events. Easy to forget things. End of day wrap-up can be really important. Also helps to pull content back from breakout rooms as they can derail there a little. Lots of different things happening in there, didn't feel like there was enough time to pull all the threads together. 
- Homework from Day 1-day 2. Really disliked this after a long day! Not sure about the time commitment of assigning homework, people probably don't do it. Taking it out, especially for the 4 day things?
- Mark: pedagogy of online workshops. Data Carpentry planning to add homework because spreading out week to week. Last thing we want to do is something before bed, but for week-longs might maintain connection when other things are competing for attention. Haven't really done this enough to think about it. At some point if we throw too many things into homework we're just going back to lecture/response mode. Told instructors to be guarded.
- Sarah: homework would be spread out more (or could be) so it wouldn't be so concentrated. Centrally vs self-organized workshops between day 3&4 vs preparing to teach days 2-3. 
- Annika: 2 things at play. One might be culture. Norway really dislikes homework. Even Python workshops if we give homework (repeat or try on your own) people just won't do it. Cannot build on the assumption that people have done or read the things. Other concern is having much less capacity, even after a half day, just drained and will not read anything. Especially if it has to be read on the screen. Without COVID things might be different could go outside refresh and meet people. At this time every small assignment creates a lot of strain. Really want to take that away. 
- Mark: Add on to that, work space & home space. Normally never wear shoes at home, but wear shoes to work. Now asking for homework invades home bubble.
- We could add time to How We Operate to review central/self-organized workshop
- Last half day... re-design to stand alone? A quick refresher for Instructors. What does it mean for me, highlight roles as host, how to use if it's not 2 certified instructors teaching, but introducing people to The Carpentries fresh.
- We get the most emails from our instructors about workshop websites. Every single workshop. Always like to cover that during instructor training.
- Incubator lesson on working with Jekyll/Gh-pages
- Could we sprinkle the lunch break (no longer necessary) into shorter breaks during the workshop?+1
- Bianca: observing another training, took short stretch breaks. During lockdown everyone sits too much, poor posture, this really affects your focus. Even 2-3 minutes makes a difference.+1  If we do stick to the 2 day schedule, is it possible to have the breaks at the same time? Putting the breaks at different times each day generates complaints. Also in the text there is an omission re library carpentry -- will PR.
- Angelique ran first IT online event in S Africa last week. Took every day literally split in half. Second day ended up shorter, didn't take break time into consideration. Worked well having 2 live coding on same day. Going in not knowing anything, then feedback, then ending with second session and debrief, stickies were great. Went fine. Last day discuss more in depth regarding the websites. Not everyone is familiar with git, Erin's video came in handy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ag1JiZzyUQ
- Shows how to switch between the workshop types

- Separate convo about demos: There is a possibility for having a notetaker. Have taken this opportunity to get familiar with the teaching demos, and because really great feedback from the host Trainers that this was super helpful that they could focus on their part, there was someone to help etherpad management. With the new Trainer agreement could we support this role a bit more, promoting notetaker/coteaching demos? Felt very nice not being alone there. It's a lot of wranglig
- Historically we went from 2 trainers 2 1 for capacity reasons. Having new people serve in that second Trainer role. 

(If time) Trainer application review updates

Agenda:
### Introductions
### Pre and post workshop discussion
- Back from May, but Christina took notes! So can remember. Trained with Kari. So great to see what others do. Took time to have everyone introduce themselves, which often skip, but really set a dynamic in the group that was useful later on. Worries about time, but was worth it. Maybe 12 people, so not huge either. Lots of Carpentries meetings we always do introductions even if a larger group and it's really impactful. Kari calls on people and in a really engaging way. C tends to wait for people to volunteer. Recap at beginning of day 2, ___ what do you remember from yesterday? Worked well.
- How learning works asking people to define some of the terms in their own words, repeating those new key words more than once was useful for helping people to get things fixed in their minds.
- Paula: Were breakouts used?
- Chrstina: only in practice situations.
- Ann: was 12 a good size?
- Christina not totally sure it was 12 (have taught another workshop recently). More than 15 feels unwieldy, less than 8 feels small. 12 is kind of a nice spot to hit. With a small group you have to keep calling on people so they never get to take a break; with a large group it's hard to create enough opportunities to participate. In person you could do more without losing those opportunities to participate, because small group work is easier.
- Elizabeth first IT with 25 people teaching with Eric. Lots of complications in attendance. 100% on for both days because were tracking who was called on, no stepping back. Had them introduce to each other in breakouts. Had them give answers when called on then introduce the person they talked to. These introductions broke up the content, introduced fun into the first day. 
- Christina maintainers onboarding call with Angela 20+ people on the call, still did intros, made it clear that they needed to be short and had people use a clear prompt.
- Ann we try to bring some use of senses into the introductory piece. Coming in from other meetings. Short meditation with eyes closed, think about the best online experience, and why was it so? Just that physical thing, closing eyes, brought people into the moment -- good feedback on that. Stretches, claps, leaving baggage from meetings behind.
- Paula: 1 minute mime used in CarpentryCon meeting. People will do it for 1 minute. We did an under the water theme. Asked for vounteers in another activity for leader and photographer

### Announcements
- Voting for trainer agreement is still open
- Trainer applications are now closed, but are open for us to review. :)
- We got 41 applications! over 10 countries
- Could use a few more reviewers. Contact Karen!

### Topic of the month: half day training events
- What are the challenges and opportunities of a 4 half-day event?
- When to do breaks? (people seem to like to know in advance when the breaks are, but also may be upset if one doesn't keep to schedule) - if they are different every day but scheduled in advance does that work?
- How to handle the wrap-up/recap and homework -- and introductions on the morning of each day. I would really have a plan for this, partially to adress Arin's concerns about the longer gap between sessions. 
- Do activities balance across the four days?
- Christina: I think so. The activities are different across the sections (more "write an exercise" for how learning works; more sharing for positive environment, "practice" in the teaching skills). we could maybe have a better mix, but that's more a reflection of the material itself than splitting into four days! Something to think about!
- Do the four themes divide into the four days? (How learning works, building teaching skills, creating a positive environment, carpentries history + culture) -- roughly, but not *exactly*
- Ann: Way to intersperse (hands-on) actual practice teaching throughout? E.g., I learn a new technique/skill/knowledge and then I focus on that in particular - what does it feel like? How is it different whenI teach a particular segment? Then break. Then next "new" technique and apply that in the same segment (practice teaching). And keep building bit by bit onto the same "teaching segment" and applying/changing bit by bit. Building the teaching segment. Learn-Do. Learn-Do. <-- this should really be the case no matter how we divide the material!  Ann: Agree! :)
- day 1 splits reasonably-ish at least, but splitting day 2 as is would be one whole haf day of teaching and one whole hald day of less activity...
- have split and done 13,20,21,14-18, 23-25 before it works well, so a possible day 3/4 could be 13,20,21,14,15// 17,18, 23-25
- Could easily do the second live coding session on the afternoon of day 2 -- that morning of day 2 is already super long and there's time to add it in the afternoon. 
- yes in the abovethe 2nd teaching falls in the afternoon
- add more "reflection episodes" like 12 & 13 so that each break is effective// preparation. (homework) time in the workshop
- Wrap up and homework could be done on etherpad to allow for the extra time that online training can take
- Shorter sessions can handle shorter breaks - you could do 2 (or 3) x 5 min breaks - use cuckoo.team to get people back in time
- Would try to avoid waiting for the 3 session to be the first time they get to teach/live coding. [technically there is teaching practice + feedback in 2nd session, but it's not live coding] It seems that adding a few exercises/ or homework in the first and second session to have them practice will be beneficial
- Opportunity: if you have all sessions in the morning is that you avoid the post-lunch slowdown +1 also give people the afternoon to do their own work. +1 mornings are best!
- Opportunity: reduce cognitive load -- the one day of material is a LOT. 
- Challenge: in our experience, learners will not commit (due to work/life) to 4x 1/2 days on one  week, b/c that means they have 1/2 a week for work, often the afternoon when they're already tired, OR they're dead in the afternoon, b/c they tried to cram a day of work into 1/2 day in the morning. We run "normal" 2 day Carpentries workshops, and quickly realised learners would skip 1-3 hours throughout the week with this setup. Our approach has  been to stagger it across 2 weeks, 2 consecutive mornings or afternoons each week.
- could it be an option to run with lunch 2h before and 2h after? this would give a larger break time inbetween
- could give a bit more homework? Possibilities for out-of-class (to save time): 
- think another thing that might be video able is the workshop website page setup (with a short Q&A/flipped style in class).  (Darya)
- the How We Operate homework (Karen)
- Lex's and Greg's videos of poor teaching come to mind (Evgenij)
- Challenge: we may expect attrition over 4 days, like playing a test match. If we can build momentum in a way that we can give the end up front, i.e. checkout, then build from there. 
- Challenge: The gap between sessions is not short.  Have to keep that longer gap in mind.
- Liz: reframing of trainer training from an "event" to a "practice" as it goes from an intensive 2-day format to a more spread-out multi-day event+ 1
- Liz: I guess my question (coordinating and scheduling instructor training inaust/nz/oceania region) is also informed by looking for ways to support local trainers community. for example, these meetings are difficult to make across our timezones, so as much as I aoppreciate connecting with everyone here, what can be adjusted that better suits local conditions.

Agenda:
### Introductions
- Trainer Agreement: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k1aVugtMqLAjYhuuyUylkEt91kLQ3Jdj6dRGZsbJbvk/edit?usp=sharing

### Notes:
- Introduction: Define and motivate text to current trainers agreement - first two paragraphs of https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k1aVugtMqLAjYhuuyUylkEt91kLQ3Jdj6dRGZsbJbvk/edit
- Goal: text to share with supervisor and what does the role entail
- Adding version tracking to the greater document - this document V2
- Show dont tell policy was not very visible - updated to showcase this
- Community members participate in various ways - we want to be flexible in the service community members provide (i.e. custom trainer agreements)
- A unit structure was created. 
- 48 units of service (could look like)
- 2 instructor training events
- 4 teaching demos
- 1 add training event (bonus modules)
- Leadership role
- Trainer meetings
- We recommend: Keeping skills  up and teaching one event a year/4 teaching demos a year
- MoU with service of trainer - plantinum membership for loca/institutional training - does this count as a teaching event? This will be negotiated during new trainer agreements/membership agreements. 
- Scholarship training: Case by case basis. If a trainer asks Carpentries to sponsor an event, this wont count to units. 
- What does not count: 
- keeping up with notes if meeting not attended
- reading emails sent to TopicBox
- Keeping up to date with curriculum/github
- Teaching curriculum that fulfills all of the current requirements for instructor certification - this might be omitted. 
- Provide feeedback
- How to step down as a trainer - some guidelines, will be reviewed. 
- No changes of alumni status as seen in Carpentries Handbook. 
- If you can think of any language changes to the document - do so by comments. 

Questions:
Alex : Selforganised instructor training (all organisation of event) - 16 units don't count for the 48 as mentioned above. Clarification needed. 
Karen: Distinction is not local vs global, but if the MOU/membership has written in the service of a local instructor. Thus, self-organised without MOU then it counts, if self-organised within MOU then it does not count (unless negotiated in MOU; a discount is given if local trainer offeres hrs of service). 
Kari: Business team will look at all agreement of volunteers - will look at the language, make sure it is compliant to regulatory laws. Some of the changes we cant vote on since it is about compliancy. We need to communicate this to the community.
Karen: We are trying to get an updated agreement out for the new cohort of trainer. CI had an interest in reviewing the language and also to make sure all are regulatory. We are replacing v1 with v2 which they have not looked at. CI will looked at language, they might come back with changes and we need to think about how we are going to 'deal' with this possiblity. We are not asking trainers to agree to the agreement until September (once CI has reviewed all the volunteer agreements).
Paola: Not part of an agreement. Could you expand on scholarship based events. I would like to participate in instructor training first in Spanish then English. Main goal to expland instructors in South America, we dont have organisations with memberships but would like to make use of the scholarship events/opportunities. 
Karen: we will do this case by case. South America is a growth area - and your role is to help grow the role. Sponsorship events are made for these initiatives. Baseline - scholarship events will not count for units but will evaluate case by cas
Alex: Reconsiling the roles of instructors and trainers. Most trainers are instructors. My role of trainer supercedes my role as instructor. We should think about teaching at workshops to count as training events and vice versa - to fulfill the instructor/trainer agreement. 
Karen: Instructor agreement - we dont cut anyone if they arent active but lose voting rights. Services as instructor act as services as trainer - sounds good but not sure if we can do it. We need to run enough instructor training events through out the year. Our leadership council can make these type of requests - the panel can be responsibile for reviewing the requests. When the time comes for trainer agreement renewal the information gathered will give us more direction on how to move forward.

Agenda:
### Introductions
- Trainer Agreement:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k1aVugtMqLAjYhuuyUylkEt91kLQ3Jdj6dRGZsbJbvk/edit?usp=sharing

Units: 
- Note that the proposed system does not require a major change in commitments from the current system (2 teaching events, 12 meetings, 4 demos)
- Communicate this to trainers when talking about these changes

Review of removed line ("Teaching a curriculum that fulfills all of the current requirements for instructor certification")
Issue 1: do you need to teach regular workshops in *addition* to instructor training events in order to stay a "member in good standing" aka can vote in Carpentries elections (not quite the same as being a badged instructor)
Issue 2 (riffing on "standard curriculum" discussion): maybe say somewhere that *instructor training* should use the standard curriculum? Would go elsewhere in the doc, maybe under the definition of instructor training. 
Issue 3 (original intent?): Trainers may also run SWC/DC/LC workshops themselves (as instructors) - these don't count toward "trainer" effort (but are probably a good idea). But again, not required to stay a trainer (and not required to maintain member status, see Issue 1) and doesn't count toward trainer commitments. 

- question: does being a trainer and fulfilling trainer requirements also meet the requirements of being an instructor or do you also need to teach a certain number of regular workshops

follow up with suggestion in the document to create some personas which model different pathways for making up the 48 units; recognising that some trainers may be covering both instructor training and SWC/DC/LC workshops.

Real-time Notes:

There have been conerns about meeting capacity for IT workshops when we allow the option of teaching only one instead of two, but we anticipate that it will not be an issue, but if it is, we may need to come begging. These agreements are not binding - they are primarily intended to be a way to approach people about training on a yearly basis and to evaluate what it is that we (Trainers) do-do. People will not be kicked out - these are guidelines.

Tracking these 48 units is still on an honor system. The Core Team will be able to give reports back out to Trainers about some things and we will be actively working to show you other accomplishments in a rewarding way.

Ariel: would be cool to say to Trainers as a way to thank you for what you do as a Trainer, we provide this impact report. Would help me justify my time as a Trainer if I had an easy way to prove the impact an individual Trainer is having. Karen: we are working on it!

Sarah B.: What is the term of the agreemetn? Calendar year? 1 year from when you are certified? 
Karen: We sort of ask people to do a calendar year after you are certified, but really we will be renewing the whole commuity in September. this is still informal, and we will be basically asking once a year "Are you sure that you still want to do this?" Because now we actually have a way to step down, which we did not have before. If you do renew as an active trainer and then need to step down during the course of the year, you can always change that status. We are also looking at this more in aggregate, so activities don't need to fall specifically between September to September. 

Ariel: how long can we be inacctive? Karen: at the bottom of this agreement is some stuff about being an inacctive trainer (not part of the agreement). Right now it says that if you come back within 3 months, there is nothing that you need to do to resume active Trainer status. Between 3 and 12 months, Trainer needs to have a meeting with Karen. If it has been more than a year, we may have updated the curriculum so we would need to be sure that the Trainer was updated on curriculum/community. 

Karen: when we ratify this agreement, we are not agreeing to it. We are agreeing about what we will or will not agree to as Trainers in September.

Karen will be addressing the comments in the document after this meeting, and then submit a PR with instructions that teh PR should be held. Trainers will be receiving a link to vote on this agreement. We are hoping to get a majority vote before next Wednesday in order to have the agreement before the new Trainer cohort is recruited. Karen will send a heads up to the Trainers list. We need a simple majority to pass, but this also means that we need a majority to actually vote. 

We will not be refusing to renew people who have not been active so far this year. We may contact you and say "Are you sure you still wanna do this?"

Not sure will be able to get the profiles in, but this has really helped with language!

Agenda:
### Introductions
### Pre and post workshop discussion
Karen and Jeff taught a standard online workshop. Jeff teaches calmly and linearly, and Karen's style is different (mostly excitement) - kept to time, covered most activities, and successfully. Was a smooth workshop
people's cameras were off during the main session, and Jeff and Karen didn't ask people to turn them on. Learning from others that asking might be a violation of privacy
during breakouts, everyone had their cameras on. Karen hopped fromm breakout to breakout, and could recognise people.
Required trust, that people were engaged. Comms in the Etherpad were helpful / reassuring. Turned out better than Karen thought it would.
Thoughts on asking people to share their cameras?
Sarah S.: a month ago, in a workshop, 50% of people had cameras off (and were very apologetic about it throughout once Sarah expressed it's great to see people's faces ). 
Sarah has been encouraging instructors to ask folks to respond when they are following along instead of only asking for them to ask questions or let them know if they are having trouble Then you get some feedback even if you can’t see them. And know that some portion of the room is following along at least. Examples: "Please type I've got R studio open if you've opened Rstudio and see what I see" or "Please type I've got the data or something about the data in chat if you've downloaded the data, unzipped it, and moved it to your folder" 
Sher!: taught one with Sarah Brown in mid-June where people had cameras off for the first morning. Put in a request for cameras to be turned on, and it was 50-50 afterward 
Margareth: not possible to have video on in Ethiopia - bandwidth issues
Sue: having camera on is no guarantee that people are concentrating. It falls on us to engage our audience more often via chat, collaborative documents like Etherpad, etc. Also important to articulate how difficult it is to know how the audience is faring - encourage them to 'overcommunicate'
Virtual backgrounds are also a good option for people nervous about their surroundings
Maneesha: did a training a bit ago where people were back in their offices with masks on, and so they kept their cameras off. This (cameras off) might continue even after people stop working from home in the coming days
Margareth: Internet will be off in Ethiopia from Monday because of security issues, which might affect an upcoming training in the week of July 20
have had to prepare videos in advance based off of Carpentries resources, although co-trainers are not Carpentries trainers
Karen: appreciates this, Carpentries is thinking about innovations, hybrid versions of delivering workshops in a way that makes sense for specific contexts - hopes it all works out
Margareth will report back after
Elizabeth and Eric: Eric has shared lots from his experiences as a seasoned instructor, that has been very helpful as Elizabeth preps for an upcoming training. Karen says being vocal about areas one is struggling with as they prep is good practice.
Announcements (Karen)
Coming switch to Google Form for teaching demo reports (instead of emailing checkout).https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNiTE1NmNWcavQNwrS76N7Cpmb75ZXnZwsq-Zeh-z3VyBxFw/viewform
after a demo, demo hosts are currently required to send an email to checkout@carpentries.org
to standardise practices across The Carpentries, trainers will soon start filling a google form instead, similar to how discussion hosts currently do it
this will allow Carpentries Core Team to analyse info from demo sessions periodically i.e. how many people are copy-pasting rather than live-coding, etc
info communicated via email will still be collected via the form. Question about no-shows might / might not remain - we currently don't use this info, but is great in case we want to enforce accountability - opinions welcome
Share feedback on edits that should go into the form before it goes live as soon as possible - share with Karen Word.
Feedback from Mike Trizna: Might be better to ask how many no-shows or last-minute cancellations to keep things quantitative.
Sarah S: Random observation from teaching demos, folks have naturally started pretending they are teaching in zoom instead of before when they would pretend like they are teaching in person.  Angelique has noticed this too.
Preparing for Trainer Agreement updates. Looking to add flexibility & clarify ambiguous/unstated guidelines. Will use 2nd meeting time slot this month ('placeholder' on the calendar) to discuss new draft agreement, with options for asynchronous review.
a number of people reached out last year and asked for custom trainer agreements as the standard one didn't suit their contexts
want to be more specific about ways people can be actively involved, allow room for people to be part of a Trainers council (coming soon), incorporate infor about involvement in Bonus Modules, etc
Karen will draft something that encompasses all the needs Karen has identified over time, and share it with Trainer leadership first, then with community before the changes are formalised and adopted for the next year
New round of Trainer Training will start in September
Let Karen know if you would like to be involved with the process 
Updates on Trainers Leadership group formation & activities! Four main areas of focus that this group has identified and is currently working on:
- Regional Hub development
community building at a local level. Introductions have been done, they will work with the Community Development Team
- Curriculum maintenance
Sarah Brown is now onboard and leading this, alongside Christina nad Tim Dennis
- Governance & elections planning
Kelly working with Mark Laufersweiler for a structure around governace and elections
- Asynchronous community engagement
this needs lots of input from everyone, please get in touch if you would like to get involved
how do we support and effectivel engage people who are not able to join in / come to meetings?
Planning ahead for next curriculum update (to commence ~end of 2020). Sarah Brown has set up these:
https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/projects/3
https://www.zotero.org/groups/1163904/carpentries/library
Context: when Tim first became an instructor, he thought about bibliography and Zotero and Carpentries resources - worth looking at to see if anything comes out of this work

### Topic of the month: Online Training Recommendations V2!
Instructor survey preliminary report (n = 40 but pseudoreplication):https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UAfKr8bK8E3f4hYGHpeRlVVh8RISg2ypcT0h3iCPxI0/edit?usp=sharing
Proposed updates:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yleW_1X-0s93yoyQLZiNF-JTqtVmie6cH7xaICVEaY0/edit?usp=sharing
Online training seems to be going well - we haven't heard of burnout as much, yet. Kelly and Karen have put together a preliminary report,see above. Need to figure out the pseudoreplication problem - can't currently capture what specific workshops people taught
we are not scaring instructors away with our current approach :)
reports of people abandoning breakouts as some participants drop off at that point
59% don't think curriculum needs to change to support teaching online
lots of coments around challenges in running exercises
time runs out, need for more suitable exercises for an online setting
those who go to breakouts have great things to say about it 
On updates to be made
Making some changes around chronological flow of workshops. Add comments on proposed updates - anyone can add comments. 
Need to address accessibility too. We will be emphasizing that people check with participants ahead of their workshops to find out what accessibility needs they have
Need to offer formal recommendations about captioning
how to use breakout rooms, private messaging and waiting rooms
overwhelmingly positive feedback on use of breakout rooms, will be adding recommendations around these
Mike: are we getting more requests from Members for centrally-organised workshops? 
Member orgs getting more instructors (supporting instructors are a bonus now)
Members were recently surveyed on their approach to online trainings, and got mixed feedback 
Elizabeth: anecdotal impressions: some members are excited about new Carpentries programs in an online setting, using recommendations from The Carpentries. We might benefit from a regional study as some Members in some regions / countries are strongly pro in-person workshops. 
Question The Carpentries is actively thinking about: how and when we will determine we are at the end of the pilot phase of the Online Workshops Project. No answers yet, we will be updating in the coming weeks.

Karen will help for open training slots
2x week for 4 weeks (splitting at breaks)
opportunities
more homework
better spaced repetition
more dynamic co-teaching instead of resting while observing
Karen & Jeffrey (post)
nice that IT is built for online
balance of time for depth & covering enough
least time challenged
did not ask for video, cameras typically off in main room, but on in breakouts
Sarah Brown(post)
used cuckoo timer for exercises. The ones that used it really liked having the warning.
Didn't have many videos on for the first half.
Used slides from Sher
Interesting to see how people customise the slides and think about it.
Very small group. 10 people with one person leaving midway
Most teaching practice in pairs.
Highly effective for time management
Less feedback, but more time.
Many community college faculty
More expected to actually teach than our usual cohort
Questions were in-depth, but appreciated reframing and recontextualising
From Brian: Sarah found some url issues with the exporter. I'm working up a PR to fix. If there are any other issues, let Brian know? 
Angela(post)
planned in person moved online, 
most knew one another, but a few external people, would have notified
used google doc
proposal remove grit due to inclusion issues?
submit an issue, esp with a reference
used Christina's notes: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/17UH-jKiCyLRU3BQ6OABYejVULysKcrxl
Where to aggregate ways people customize? Discourse?

to match the community discussion process
collect assessment data
only opportunity for summative assessment
repeat request: to gather feedback on why people repreat, for the sense of what reasons and to track learning
tracking no shows:
what is a no show?
Perfrmance assessment 
will add episdode vs lesson
feedback on trainees' feedback on others
sometimes this demonstrates more of what they learn
Question: why optional?
Karen iwll check on what is there; required are necessary for procedure of checkout
Preparing for Trainer Agreement updates. Looking to add flexibility & clarify ambiguous/unstated guidelines. Will use 2nd meeting time slot this month ('placeholder' on the calendar) to discuss new draft agreement, with options for asynchronous review.
goal is more options than last year
last year nearly all custom requests were honored
process:
core team
trainer leadership
all trainers
approval and enactment

Goals: ultimately an elected leadership panel
So far: several meetings, broken into 4 different areas

gathering info from survey + blog posts etc to proposed updates
reorganizing into chronological from thematic
also many small changes, noted on discourse
accessibility
emphasize in preworkshop e-mail
captioning?
accomodations
managing disruptions
recommend the use of breakouts
even though it's a lot of work
requires reworking exercises 
should we pose to maintainers a possible influx of exercise PRs
EC considering end of pilot phase
comment on the document
Christina: Can there be a 1 page visual summary?
possibly checklist with links
