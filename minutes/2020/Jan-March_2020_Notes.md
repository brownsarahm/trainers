### Introductions
### Pre and post workshop discussion
- Karen will be running a workshop in Florida. Will have more on the debrief side of things.

### Announcements

### Topic of the month: CarpentryCon 2020!
- Sign up for lightning talks/poster presentations now
- "Pico" presentations at EGR?
- https://egu2019.eu/abstracts_and_programme/pico.html
- Incentives for new instructors - offering something that is marked as peer reviewed means people can treat it like a normal conference. Solve for people's promotion models. Can they put it on their CV/promotion docs?
- Local improve group at CarpentryCOnnect Otago -- went over really really well with everyone
- Question: none of the submissions have deadlines on them. This is disconcerting -- has a secret deadline passed? When should we hear back? Soft deadlines or rolling etc. 
- Deadlines for financial aid are rolling and contingent upon sponsorship. Will clarify that language. LIghtning talks and poster sessions... did put a deadline on proposals for talk or workshop and should be accepting within next week or so. 
- Day 3 lots of open sessions first two days sort of numbered. When will it be more fleshed out? Will a lot still be up in the air unconference style?
- There will be a birds-of-a-feather type thing, so there will be a little structure and also a lot of unconferencey things. At 2018 we had a board up for meetups. Maybe having subcommunity meetups
- In other news... COVID-19. As of right now we are still proceeding as planned. However we are looking heavily at UW if they have bans, airlines, governments, decisions etc. April 1 will announce whether it will proceed as in-person or virtual conference. Either way something will happen. 
- Appreciate the specificity in what will factor in to decision making
- Global conference, so many factors. Right now people would be looking to buy tickets. But. So we do need to be as clear as we can. Even if we do have a virtual conference we want it to be accessible.
- One of the big things likely to affect international people is what travel insurance is doing. Medical insurance in particular is really scary. Brian says they have been banned for all international travel (By MQ -- anticipate other workplaces doing this? NZ is still travel but heavily reduced but no insurance avaialble for covid) for the foreseeable future.

Agenda:
### Introductions
### Pre and post workshop discussion
- Sarah: any suggestions for the first half of the first day?
- KJ: set the tone of positivity and commonality, because it is going to be a long two days! 
- KJ: Uses the "What are you proud of" ice-breaker and that helps find people find things they have in common. 
- CK: keep people engaged; it is a lot of talking, so actively asking them questions to keep them engaged helps and also gives you a good way to guage if people are listening.
- KW: keep an eye on the time, it is easy to let the first day get away because people are enthusiastic. There is a fair amount that can be cut back in the beginning, if you would like to let your group do their thing, so just pay attention, don't force it, but keep time for later. 
- CK: had a group of 20 and each person had to go around and say thier name and say what they thought they had in common with the other people in the group, then everyone that did have that in common stepped forward. Helps to feel connected because at least a few people had something in common with everyone. Not sure how to do this online exactly...

### Announcements
- Did you see Toby's recommendation of this countdown timer tool for demos?  https://cuckoo.team/carpentries-teaching-demo
- Paula Andrea: Give everyone the link, they automatically sign in anonymously, so it doesn't ask to register or name or anything. You start the counter clicking on the 5 ball and it shows it concurrently to everyone. The only thing you need to do before hand is check if audio is allowed from the page, if not allow it for the time being, it should be a question on the browser tab that you are using.
- Clarification on lesson contributions: all contributions to all Carpentries repos (but only Carpentries repos) are being counted for checkout at this time. However, we are not ready to *solicit* contributions across the board (eg Carpentries Labs). Trainees can be counseled that the purpose of this checkout step is to engage with the process of lesson contribution in our community; maintenance varies across repos and lack of response or acceptance of a change should not be taken personally. - Karen or any Core Team
- New Trainer trainees have been added to Topicbox (yay!) and will shortly be added to #Trainers on Slack. - Karen
- Registration for Carpentry Con is open! https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/01/register-for-carpentrycon/
- Topic of the month: Scheduling Instructor Training events!

- Maneesha presenting - want to give an overview of instructor training event process for everyone to see and discuss

Three main components that are part of making instructor training happen! 
1) Members joining (any time during the year) and using training seats anytime during the year (either via a public traning - see 2 below - or an individual training)
2) Scheduling a public calendar of training events (for both members + open applications)
3) Having an Instructor Training - requires infrastructure (eventbrite + zoom commitment), communication w/ trainers and trainees, post-training checkout process, ongoing communication w/ members

- Suggestions wanted!
- How can we make the sign-up/scheduling process for public events easier/less labor intensive? 
- A completely alternative way to handle event scheduling? 
- Can we make meaningful connections by who we schedule for a specific event? 

***Questions/Comments:***
- Ann: has heard about challenges in scheduling amongst Australia because they are so far apart from each other and it's expensive to fly/hard to coordinate. 
- Maneesha: for remote trainings, more important that people are in the same time zones; for in-person trainings, have to communicate that money is needed for flights/travel expenses
- Follow up Q: can you do mixed-mode trainings?
- M: We have tried it, how you do it can vary. If one group (trainers + trainees) are together and another group of trainees are remote, that doesn't work well, but if you have groups of co-located trainees + a remote trainer(s), that can work.
- Karen: it can work, but it can also go badly. The key is making sure everyone can participate equally. 
- A: are trying this with other trainings (not instructor training), so can report back
- Laura: can we use previous data to predict which trainings might be under-/over- enrolled? 
- Maneesha: working with a limited amount of data (1 year) but is planning to look at this
- Follow-up Q: is it possible to share this data with the community, make it a public data problem?
- Maneesha: probably could, if data was anonymized
- Christina: has the calendar of public events worked well (even if it's a pain to schedule)?
- Maneesha: that has worked well! The challenge in creating them is the hard part. 
- Caroline: make a tentative list of events/trainers - so people can sign up for existing events as a "second/backup" if their event is canceled. 
- Maneesha: try to send reminders, can make sure those are getting through. 
- Christina: do we have a set up where people can sign up as backups, once the public calendar comes out?
- Laura - will follow-up later about sites w/o members

- New Trainer trainees have been added to Topicbox (yay!) and will shortly be added to #Trainers on Slack. - Karen
- Topic of the month: Scheduling Instructor Training events! - you may consider recording Maneesha's presentation
- Extra items
- Australia training coordination
- NZ training coordination
- Experimental 8w training, Darya/Brian
- https://prezi.com/view/s9jXZPVWhPWJYsShvls1/

- Matthias: ARDC is volunteering my time (0.2 FTE) to work as a regional coordinator in Australia with Damien Irving. Mandate will be to work with members and do more community building things that Damien doesn't have time to do. What would work well is to plan a calendar of events out for the whole calendar year. Universities there do their planning on the Academic year which matches up with the annual calendar. Don't necessarily frontload the year with lots of instructor training. Darya has to take annual leave to do training, and also likes to see her family, so needs lots of notice. The preference in australia seems to be in-person trainings. Because members and Trainers are not distributed similarly, this new batch of Trainers will hopefully help (though still distributed a bit weirdly). What could work for Australia, there is a big preference for in-person training, online 2-day training is pretty heavy, so spreading out over 8 weeks migh towkr. Concerns over attrition, but ARDC would ike to train up more instructors in areas without lots of instructors, with the blessing of their employers. By getting employer buy-in maybe we can combat attrition.
- Murray: Very similar vein to what's the case in New Zealand.
- Maneesha: We've definitely seen that scheduling seems to work differently in Aus/NZ
- Brian: CUltural norms around paying for travel here are very different than in the uS. As an example the UTS training where we flew people in from the other side of the country -- the frustration doesn't map too well. IN the states flying someone from NY to Chicago isn't a big deal, but here so much more bureaucracy is involved in that than you might expect. 
- Matthias: Asking people to pay for transport on top of the membership is actually a big chunk of the university budget -- they could employ someone 1 day a week for the same price as the membership and might be more useful. 
- Liz: Quite true. In terms of membership you often find it's the smaller units that are the true believers trying to carve out a membership seeing the long view, but their pots of money don't necessarily cover. Wants to mention discussion of community calls. Core work hours have been implemented at University in Sydney around having more family-friendly work hours. 10AM-4PM in effort to make it easier to get a broader cross-section and include part-time staff, those with child responsibilities. Sometimes even 3 isn't great. This is a really good mode of scheduling that would like to see in The Carpentries. UTC 02:00 crosses those core work hours across Aus/Nz/Maylasia. Would be a good model for scheduling Community Discussions and any Trainer meetings for this time zone. 
- Maneesha: Community calls & teaching demos used to be scheduled at fixed times because we didn't have the staff capacity to schedule. We've now implemented Calendly scheduling of demo sessions, hoping that Trainers reflect a good cross-section of the community. We are about to pilot doing the same thing for Community Discussions. Hosts will select their own times, hoping they will schedule things that a better representation of community will attend
- Darya: Talking about piloting distributed online training would allow to teach without taking leave. Would be easier for others in the Aus/NZ community to become certified. Why don't we just try using this time. Quite a few people who have been approved have tried to find online events and can't find anything. This is something that might work. Don't know who even is on the waiting list to become an Instructor. 
- Maneesha: Whole process - we recognize this is skewed for US/Canada time zones. We have asked for availability but it doesn't always fit. It seems more clear why this is more of a challenge than it might be other places.
- Murray: ONe thing we've tried with NZ is when we have an INstructor training to schedule a few slots for demos and let people know they need to sign up quickly. This might help to schedule exact demos with the trainings
- Darya: would love that. Would love to help out. 
- Murray: West coast US likes our time slots and they get in there real fast.
- Karen : can connect Open trainees w Darya
- Murray: scheduling training events we almost prefer to go to our regional coordinator and ask who needs trainings, set them up and sort them out. The 3 month calendar doesn't work well. 
- Megan: really happy to be in that role and have been movin in that direction. Confusing because never know really where my place is -- need to be more part of these conversations. Easy for me to find who is looking to get training. 
- Matthias: Anecdote from this week. Currently reaching out to member orgs one of them got back to me and said not all of last year's instructors could do Demos yet. Emailed Karen but Brian offered to do one. Been coordinator for about a month. Still working out who is the right person to talk to about what. All deliberately divided up. Who does community discussions? 
- Darya: Having our folks talk to people overseas leaves them out of the loop for local community events. Having Matthias as the contact to coordinate who wants online and who wants in-person training would be ideal. Local citations also matter
- Megan: what we did last year in NZ was send out expression of interest to see who wanted to attend, then told The Carpentries what dates work, ran them then as regional coordinator kept a spreadsheet (small enough that one person could do that). Tracked and introduced to those people. Really successful making the effort - massive +1
- Murray: I think the regional coordinators are in a very powerful position to grow the local communities due to their ability to know what's going on regionally

### Introductions
### Pre and post workshop discussion
### Announcements
- Staff changes! Karen is now full time as Director of Instructor Training. Also hiring a new Deputy Director of Instructor Training! Stay tuned for blog post with more details soon.
- Deputy Director of instructor training - will be looking for someone with an education / assessment background so we can do more with assessing what we do. 
- Additional online trainings requested in Aus/NZ, North American Central & Eastern time zones. 
- For more details: https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/trainers/T8b173b0ba32761e4/carpentries-online-instructor-training-march-april-2020
- Enter availability here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWRCDunqpWiITzB57Pu9HHDUydPGeOJhRpW9xkWnCUuISyaQ/viewform
- Please add demo slots on Calendly if you haven't previously included the January-March time period in your signups: https://calendly.com/carpentries-trainers-signup/checkout-demos
- New Trainers will begin training soon! If you are hosting an upcoming event or demo, new trainees may wish to attend all or part of your workshop. They can observe or you are welcome to invite them to participate.
- Feel free to email the trainer list / message in the trainer slack when you have an upcoming trainer so other people know. 
- Topic of the month 'open mic' for updates, ideas, and questions. Some examples: 
- Do you participate in another Carpentries community? Tell us what's happening! We'd love to hear updates from local communities, too. 
- This is a great time to bring up any little ideas or questions you've had kicking around, maybe those not quite big enough for a full meeting theme. 
- Consider any older ideas that you'd like to give a 'bump' to for 2020. 
- FAQ that we don't have great answers to, areas where we need more documentation (like, how do I get involved with The Carpentries beyond Instructor Training?)
- Whatever you'd like to share!
- Aleks: If you would like to send someone to instructor training - how to prioritize them (in say, open application)?
- Apply for open application, have them (or you) email Karen
- Can have one (but *only one!) person join open training even if they have an institutional membership
- Francois: Teaching demonstration question - when starting in a random place, people want to give some context before they start. It's a natural feeling, but it eats up time in the demonstration. 
- Christina: Is this happening w/ particular lesson? F: happened with three lessons
- Christina: In intro, say that you can assume that the audience has seen the previous part of the lesson, and that it will feel a bit weird to just start at the beginning.
- Also, lesson choice: some lessons are more modular than others
- Karen: Often people give a little intro, and that's nice. 
- Sarah: make it clear that they are giving a demo, not actually teaching people in the room
- Sarah: Gives her own feedback and doesn't require everyone to give feedback - what do other people do? Should everyone give feedback? 
- Kari: Do what you're comfortable with. Has everyone write down feedback, pick one person to share (rotate around), have person who did the demo give their feelings, then maybe a tip/last comment from you.
- Karen: Demo is mostly about teaching, but also about process of giving feedback. Typing in the etherpad helps deal with the issue of time. Can learn about new instructors by the feedback they give. 
- Kari: How is the demo signup going? Planning to use it for pre/post workshop discussions and want comments. 
- Laura: from an end-user perpsective, works great! Love the change. 
- Christina/Sarah: works well, but needs reminders (and documentation)
- Karen: reminder email coming out this week! 
- Sher!: How do we make sure that we can accommodate certain times / people just running their own sessions. 
- Karen: need to use calendly, mainly to reserve the room. For now, tries to check etherpad occasionally for sessions that weren't registered via calendar. 
- Follow-up Question: How do you cancel a demo if you have a conflict? 
- Should be instructions in a reminder email, received a week before the demo. 
- 1st step: try to find someone to fill in (use email, slack)
- If not able to cancel, contact people on etherpad and let them know. 
- Laura: this year, restarting the Spanish translations (slack channel, #carpentries_es has some new life)!
- Christina: Carpentry Con is coming! June 2020. Lots of ways to get involved: propose a session, design a t-shirt, apply for financial aid, direct sponsors our way, register, etc. https://2020.carpentrycon.org/
- Christina: Any updates on lesson infrastructure? 
- Francois: mainly waiting for hiring of new lesson infrastructure developer. Currently reviewing applications. 
- Karen: what are these people going to be doing? 
- Francois: Want to make it easier to contribute lessons to Carpentries incubator and develop review process for Carpentries Lab; in this process, make it easier for maintainers of current lessons to keep up their current lessons!
- Aleks: As part of Carpentry Con proposal, wanted to develop a lesson; also has short-course training materials for intermediate topics that could be contributed --> hoping to do in Carpentries lesson style and contribute to incubator. [https://cdh.carpentries.org/]
- Laura: the handbook has a lot of useful information! (link?)
- Anelda: Collaborated on a grant for funding last year, R mapping project to develop tools to map public health (and other) data for Africa. May also be developing training materials and possibly use the Carpentries. R will be used - afrimapr. Lead PI is Andy South from LSTM. Funded through Wellcome Open Research Fund.

Agenda:
### Introductions
### Pre and post workshop discussion
- 2 trainings coming up 1 with Karen Cranston, she's travling through sunday. Need to set up infrastructure. Confident about going into Training #3 or 4, Karen's super experienced, also feb 11-12 Software Carpentry workshop then Feb 19-20 online instructor Training with John Simpson. Mostly looking forward to having two in quick succession, hasn't been too big a lag between any online trainings, so not too rusty. A little different with the workshops now, it's different to get back into those! Will be good to have that in the interim. The only question around all this is checking with Elizabeth to be sure Boise State is fulfilled for platinum membership. Would be good to have verbal confirmation. There will be trainees at Boise State at the workshop for whom it will be their first workshop but probably not from that next training. 
- Groundswell of interest across the state of Idaho, newish folks up there that have begun checkout, at least one new person at Idaho State, pretty far distance apart 3-7 hrs, coalescing around collaborative computing center bonded by state legislature. Excitement around using Carpentries to help use that computing center. Big workshop out in Idaho Falls in june, trying to see where it makes sense to put effort.  200 students?
- Brian: research bazaar has a fairly decent amount of literature. Actually did 200 last time around. Ping Darya and Brian on Slack if you want to put on a Research Bazaar in Idaho. Both of us coordinate the one in Sydney, Matthias does the one in Perth. Melbourne does its own one. Murray does one in Dunedin. Takes about 2 orders more magnitude of organization than a typical workshop. Paula has done Brisbane.
- November online training with Eric. Two Trainers but one had to cancel at the last minute so Eric and Paula stepped in as well as Sher and Erin for  few hours each. Managed to prepare with enough time within a week but there were some things that would be good to know  -- didn't know that some of the trainees were from her own institution. Could have probably negotiated a bit more time if had known there were so many people from home. It may be hard to get this info, but we tend to know who people are in this community. Wonder how it is for the participants, didn't receive feedback because not a lead, did email Sher but haven't heard back. 
- Eric also wants to see that feedback too! Certainly was challenging to jump between so many different presentation styles and chunks of the schedule. There for just mornings of both days. 1-2 hours. No idea how it went. Would habe been useful to debrief afterwards. Now 3 months on trying to remember back. but oVerall went well. Also about the timing, organized centrally and times were wrong, lots of people got the wrong time. Put a time zone that changes for some parts and not others, everyone was confused including Paula. If there was someone here, they would know the time zones and community members.
- Brian this is why I pushed really hard to get Matthias appointed as a regional Instructor Training coordinator (title unknown) been pushing to know what demand is for next year so we don't have pileup. In this hemisphere please make sure your institutions are in contact with him. Important so he can represent Australia up and deal with fires before they get out of hand. 4 Australians in new trainee cohort. Someone make sure he finishes the blog post on the dinner last year -- make sure we have an instructor training community that's really good.
- Megan Guidry and Matthias (regional coordinators) could come to meetings as well. I second this motion.
- Everyone in NZ who goes through IT goes through RC. It does take a lot of effort.

***Topic of the month***
- Open Mic! 
- Murray Otago has a CarpentryConnect coming up in February mostly NZ but also some Australian community. Ties into broader e-research community and e-research conference is directly after CarpentryConnect. Coming back from holidays at the moment, locally beginning to plan the year of workshops and related trainings. Quite a few things on the calendar so far. Part of the event is to get a national calendar of events for other institutions to know what's going on. ONe brief question: as part of CarpentryConnect, it's being requested whether that can count for Discussion? Yes!
- Eric Boise state in Idaho. Lots of Carpentries-related and specific things in Idaho, which is kind of tiny interms of population 1.5 million people but 3 state funded universities across large geographic area. Lots of folks have gone through INstructor Training, statewide momentum around training computational literacies in higher ed and k12. Carpentries lens toward pedagogy fills a really urgent niche in discussions across the state. I think we're going to find opportunities and challenges in coordinating people across the state and not be duplicative while scaling best practices responsibly, not spreading anyone too thin. Eager to learn from ResBaz and other international efforts to learn how these are done
- Paula has been with the carpentries for a few years. Last year completely volunteer not a part of tole. Trying to negotiate a new role that includes a bit of Carpentries. If you have a task in your job description that I could borrow to put in my job description to negotiate with my employer would really appreciate. Executive council will take a lot of effort. Employer is a national imaging facility, but closely related with QCIF, which is a partner organization. Trying to maintain official lessons and those in the incubator.
- Masami librarian at Griffith University in Brisbane. Last year became a trainer, had a chance to deliver 2 instructor trainings, latest was last December, sorry to have missed debrief. Met Brian and Paula and Darya. During session Darya invited candidates to ResBaz took out business card to share. Griffith has Amanda Miotto champion for workshops in Brisbane already organized 8 workshops in R, python through the year. Question: Found a tweet about Japanese translations for R. Within Carpentries or byeond? Paula: group of Carpentries volunteers. Not paid so up to them how much they will do. Can put you in contact with the leader. Would love to be in touch. Person sitting behind Murray
- Brian scheduled a second teaching demo because long wait list, frontloading because lots of demand right now in that time. Two weeks unwisely doing not-a-workshop for trying to get maintainer lesson off the ground over Australia Day so Brian plus 7 students. No co-instructor, oops. Happily not a big crowd, not a formal workshop, more experimental than anything. Need to lock down instructor training. ALso hope to pilot an 8 week training, need to demonstrate that it's effective as we both want it to be (with Darya). Because not teaching this year, putting time that would have been teaching into the Carpentries. Should be a little more available so long as can justify Macquarie benefit. ANd ResBasz
- Chris Nigeria. No local community as of now. Joined in 2018. Recently made a proposal to national technology agency so they can sponsor a national research computing planning for our higher education. MY aim is if they accept to sponsor the training we are likely to involve Carpentries trainers and that could mean a formidable local community in Nigeria. Hoe
- Etherpad problems. Advisory: double check the etherpad especially for teaching demos. Ping out earlier than you might otherwise to be sure they haven't been stuck by it. Something has gone sideways just this week. Have backup plan in mind. See if Etherpad exporter still works, also. 
- Another update Research Data Alliance Webinar. CODATA/RDA program including 2 days of Carpentries workshops. Been teaching and have been replicated -- https://www.rd-alliance.org/curriculum-foundational-research-data-science-skills-early-career-researchers-1
- ANyone else going to CarpentryCon? Eric trying very hard
- Would be good to record a Carpentries workshop. Last ones recorded were maybe 5 years ago.
