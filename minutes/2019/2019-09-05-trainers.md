### Topic of the month: Zoom practice 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_O7rDILNCM
* https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html#zoom-manual

Process:

* Become the host
* Try muting someone
* Assign group into breakout rooms
* Send a message to the people in breakout rooms
* Visit a breakout room and come back to the main room
* Close breakout rooms

Observations

* Can be hard to find the "come back" button
* Breakout screens can open in a different window/monitor
* Maybe tell people in advance that the window disappears (temporarily) when you move to a breakout room and the chat may also disappear
* Where trainees are co-located you can ask them to rename themselves with their location for easier grouping

**Others attending** 

* Darya Vanichkina
* Sarah Stevens
* Rayna Harris (notetaker)
* Karen Word (host)


### Discussion

Question: What's the best way to get into instructor training in Australia?

1. Apply
2. Get in touch with the local community who can give them a better sense 
3. Get on the Australia list that is used quite extensively
4. At the moment, Paula and Darya are going to do an online distributed 8 week. Test is to see if it is effective or not at getting people better integrated into the community. Also as a better sell than taking off 2 full days of work

### Announcements

Question: Should we be archiving notes from Discussion segment of meetings? Previously, Discussion meetings were not archived.

* We used to have "business" and "discussion meetings". we didn't archive the discussion notes from these because the might contain sensitive info, but now we've been archiving them. 
* Is there a range of taking notes without detailed attribution for some points?
* Could there be an option to ask specifically for an item to be "off the record"?
* Possible guidelines for notetakers
* How valuable are the notes, since it requires a nonzero amount of time?
* Carpentries Values: Looking for volunteers to bring these questions to their local community for discussion: https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/T9029fc4692993ab1 - contact Karen (or Serah)
* Serah exploring defining the values of the community. Please reach out to your communities to encourage them to respond. 

### Topic of the month: Zoom practice 

Process:

* Become the host - 
	* Best way is to use a secret code which will be shared via topicbox and slack. Once you claim host, 
	* Be sure to hand off host privileges later on.
	* Where you do you claim host? Click on "participants" and it will be next to "mute" if no one has claimed host if unclaimed it will be next to raise hand
* Try muting someone
* Assign group into breakout rooms
* Send a message to the people in breakout rooms
* Visit a breakout room and come back to the main room
* Close breakout rooms

Observations/ questions

* Chat? Do breakout out chats work? Yes, but they are ephemeral. Maybe worth looking at the zoom account settings to look at zoom chat history options
* Be sure any messages sent to breakout groups are short so that they can read it in time
* Change in dealing with co-localized groups. Pro-tip have people customize their name and add their city by clicking in the top corner. 
* Strange obervation: if you lose the "close rooms" button, join a room and it will come back. 
* Previous host cannot be added to an existing group
