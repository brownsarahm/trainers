#### Eric Jankowski

Been a learner (17 years), instructor (~7 years) and trainer (~7 years), and have led much of the Carpentries activities and workshops at Boise State University. I like sandbox, workbench, and the bash/git/python SWC curricula the best. 


#### Mark Crowe

I have been a Carpentries Instructor for three years and a Trainer for two. I have organized around 40 Carpentries workshops over the past three years.


#### Nathaniel Porter

My first involvement with Carpentries was as a local workshop helper beginning in 2018 and I was trained as an instructor in late 2019. I have been a trainer since mid-2021 and teach around 1 training a quarter, in addition to organizing and being an instructor in around 10 technical workshops a year, primarily at Virginia Tech, my home institution, where I am the Data Education Coordinator and coordinate our team of around 20 instructors. I am also active as a maintainer for the instructor training curriculum and part of the Curriculum Advisory Committee for Data Carpentry Social Science. I have also adapted a number of Carpentries lessons to other formats or settings.


#### Paola Corrales

I became a Carpentries Trainer and Instructor in March 2020. Since then I co-organised and taught 3 Instructor Training workshops in Spanish (in 2020, 2021 and 2022) with participants from Argentina, Colombia, México, Ecuador, and Uruguay, where more than 80% have completed their checkout. I regularly host Teaching Demo and Discussion sessions in Spanish to support the Spanish-speaking community to complete the certification in the same language. In 2022 I was elected to be part of the Trainers Leadership and I hope to keep serving in that role for another year. Along with my “formal” involvement, I also teach coding, visualizations, and data management at Universidad Guillermo Brown and Universidad de Buenos Aires where I use Carpentries’ teaching strategies and lesson materials and spread the word about the community. 


#### Trisha Adamus

I have been an instructor and helper since 2016, and an instructor trainer since 2020. In 2022, I was a co-chair of CarpentryCon.


#### Zachary Painter

I became an Instructor in late 2017, and a Trainer a bit after that. I administer a lot of the functions of The Carpentries at Stanford University

## If you have served on Trainers Leadership, use this space to share a few things about your past service in this role.


#### Mark Crowe

In my first year on Trainers Leadership, I served as a general committee member, and for the last year I have held the role of chairperson. 


#### Paola Corrales

As part of the Trainers Leadership, last year I participated in the Active Status Renewal process and the discussion to ensure this process takes the trainers’ involvement and expectations into account and meets Carpentries’ needs. I also brought a different perspective to the group and contributed to the discussions. Moreover, during 2022 I learned a lot about our community and all the processes, rules, and guidelines that make it possible for the community to continue to operate and grow. I would like to continue serving in this role a put what I learned to use to contribute even more to the Trainers’ community.


## What interests you about serving on the Trainers Leadership Committee?


#### Annajiat Alim Rasel

The most important part is that it is a committee of people working together for betterment of training. I have been formally and informally mentoring fellow teachers and aspiring teachers in my department. Being part of the committee might help me both in my job and in my Carpentries related activities.


#### Eric Jankowski

1. Helping helpers! 2. Letting the election go forward! 3. Learning from, and contributing my computational teaching perspective with the brightest, most inclusive group of helpers I know. 

And 4. with varying bandwidth for running trainings, I'm also a little enticed by it counting for trainer recertification. 


#### Mark Crowe

I've enjoyed my last two years on the committee and am proud of what we've arrived in that time, and I would like to being able to continue contributing to the Carpentries and Trainer community


#### Nathaniel Porter

Both leading instructor training with various co-trainers and being part of the maintainer community has highlighted to me the importance of instructor training and the variety of approaches that can be taken to both the training and other parts of the process. Joining the leadership committee would allow me to integrate these experiences (as well as that of instructor/host and local coordinator) in helping build the community and its practices and encouraging more engagement with the community.


#### Paola Corrales

Being part of the Trainers community for a few years and with 1 year worth of experience as part of the Leadership Comittee, I believe I can help to keep building and improving the community and support the work and effort of all its members. 


#### Trisha Adamus

I would like the opportunity to streamline the process of transforming the curriculum from words into a lesson taught to a group of hopeful trainers. I have experienced differences between training sessions, such as in person and online trainings, and large and small groups of trainees. I believe that providing more guidance based on trainer observations will help the entire trainer community better prepare to teach instructor training sessions, which may be a limited factor when trainers sign up to teach.


#### Zachary Painter

I have found it hard to fit in an actual instructor trainer session to my schedule given how we schedule them, and my job situation. Having some alternate form of service would be very useful, and I think this is perhaps the way to do it as I can often attend most monthly meetings.


## What would you bring to this role that may be valuable for the Committee and/or the community?


#### Annajiat Alim Rasel

I have completed multiple teachers training (TOT) taught by facilitators from multiple countries. I bring in different perspectives and a desire to groom aspiring trainers. I have been involved with online learning management, handling buX (Open edX based local implementation), edX, Coursera and other learning initiatives in my university.


#### Eric Jankowski

The perspective of a tenure-track faculty member who got into it for the teaching, that has experienced shifting priorities and workloads during a pandemic, the perspective of someone who trains students to use HPC for materials science and engineering, and some perspective as someone who thinks a lot about identity development in STEM and how it overlaps with department cultures and teaching and training. 


#### Mark Crowe

Previous experience on the committee, a strong network within the digital skills training community, and a job that allows me to focus almost full time on training and researcher support. 


#### Nathaniel Porter

I bring experience in a variety of data education roles within and outside the Carpentries at all levels of higher education (and occasionally K12) and connections/experience in libraries, academic departments, and data archives - as well as both formal and informal technical and pedagogical training. My position as Social Science Data Consultant & Data Education Coordinator is fairly unique in that I engage regularly not only in teaching, curriculum development, and team building but also in original research (focused on data pedagogy) and research support.


#### Paola Corrales

I would like to bring a different perspective from a region where The Carpentries is not widely spread but it could highly benefit. And , while I’ll bring my own ideas, and perspective, I also won’t forget that I’m representing others. So, I would commit to not only listening but seeking others' ideas and opinions.


#### Trisha Adamus

I am a former high school teacher and current librarian. Most of my work time is spent preparing lesson plans and materials to teach workshops on a variety of topics researchers need to be successful in their studies, including programming and data management. My background in teaching and my current work directly supporting researchers could be a valuable addition to the committee.


#### Zachary Painter


## Is there an issue that you are particularly motivated to enage with as a member of the Committee? Use this space to share what interests you about the issue.


#### Annajiat Alim Rasel

We see less trainer recruitment, retention and less continuous learning. There should be one self development activity per quarter.


#### Eric Jankowski

Trainer community engagement? These folks are the best! I love hanging out with them! SO WHY AM I JUST PUTZING AROUND MY OFFICE POLISHING MY CV FOR MY UNIVERSITY'S ANNUAL EVALUATIONS INSTEAD OF HANGING OUT? More seriously, balancing the time demands on everyone's schedules and events where folks can meet and build things together is a wicked problem, and I guess I wanna help with it?


#### Mark Crowe


#### Nathaniel Porter

I am particularly interested in ways to build community and ongoing engagement among both trainers and instructors, including finding ways to encourage new instructors to become active beyond workshops.


#### Paola Corrales

One issue I'd like to work on and participate in is the implementation of the Recommended Changes to Instructor Training Checkout. The checkout process is an important part of the Instructor Training Curricula and I hope these changes will contribute to make this process a meaningful experience for new Instructors while we keep community needs in mind. 


#### Trisha Adamus

I am particularly interested in the designing support systems for Trainer community engagement. In my position as a librarian I am very interested in how to develop, and support the development of, communities of practice. I would like focus on this topic as a member of the Leadership Committee.


#### Zachary Painter


## What are your strengths in collaborative work that will help you to be effective as a member of this group?


#### Annajiat Alim Rasel

I don't feel shy to ask for help, and I feel comfortable to help others. I also participate in most meetings, listening to others and sharing my view, even if it is drastically different.


#### Eric Jankowski

I'm curious to learn new things and willing to change my mind. Schedules--particularly breaks--are sacred to me. And I no longer need to hoard accolades. 


#### Mark Crowe


#### Nathaniel Porter

I work well in distributed collaboration settings where work may be done asynchronously and seek and provide feedback and discussion from a variety of perspectives.


#### Paola Corrales

During my first year as part of the Leadership Committee I learned a lot from the other members of the committee (thank you!). I believe it is important to approach any conversation with an open mind and respect and value others' opinions. I also think is important to always remember the goals and principles of the community when making decisions. 


#### Trisha Adamus

I have worked as part of many teams, both within my institution and as part of national and international initiatives. Some of the strengths I would bring to this role include my abilities to well document committee outcomes to help with institutional memory, my communication style and frequency of communications during and after my term on the committee, and my willingness to pick up and work on any portion of a project that needs more attention and support. As part of this committee, I hope to strengthen more collaborative working skills.


#### Zachary Painter


## Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?


#### Annajiat Alim Rasel


#### Eric Jankowski


#### Mark Crowe

I apologize for any odd typos and some brief answers - I'm currently taking my family on a holiday round Europe and only have my phone available to fill in the responses!


#### Nathaniel Porter


#### Paola Corrales


#### Trisha Adamus

I am excited by the possibility to work on the Instructor Trainer Leadership Committee. I have enjoyed my many interactions with Carpentries Community members, and I look forward toward participating in a new aspect of Carpentries development.
